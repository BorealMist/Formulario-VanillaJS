# Formulario-VanillaJS
Simple form with validation built following the same scheme as FalconMasters (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3pC93LgP18&amp;t=65s)
The form is created with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS. It validates the different fields following regular expression validation, as well as checking if the 2 passwords are the same.
A brief regular expression explanation is also included in the files.
